// Ambiguity Resolution in Inheritance in C++ 
// In multiple inheritances, when one class is derived from two or more base classes 
// then there may be a possibility that the base classes have functions with the same name,
//  and the derived class may not have functions with that name as those of its base classes.
//   If the derived class object needs to access one of the similarly named member functions of the base classes
//    then it results in ambiguity because the compiler gets confused about which baseâ€™s class member function should be called.
